Child Safety Standards Policy
1. Introduction
At Procks, the safety and well-being of all users, especially children, is our top priority. We are committed to maintaining a platform free from child sexual abuse and exploitation (CSAE). This policy outlines our zero-tolerance approach to CSAE, our proactive measures to prevent and address such content or behavior, and our commitment to compliance with applicable child safety laws and global best practices.
2. Zero-Tolerance Policy on Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation (CSAE)
Procks strictly prohibits any form of child sexual abuse and exploitation, including but not limited to:
•	Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM): Any visual depiction (e.g., photos, videos, or computer-generated imagery) involving a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct.
•	Grooming: Befriending or communicating with a minor to facilitate sexual contact or exchange of sexual imagery, whether online or offline.
•	Sextortion: Coercing or manipulating a minor into producing or sharing sexual content.
•	Trafficking or Exploitation: Any activity involving the recruitment, transportation, or facilitation of minors for sexual purposes.
•	Inappropriate Content or Behavior: Content or interactions that sexualize minors, encourage harmful activities, or otherwise endanger children.
Any accounts or content found violating this policy will be immediately removed, and the responsible users will be permanently banned. Violations will be reported to law enforcement and relevant authorities, such as the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), in accordance with applicable laws.
3. Published Standards Against CSAE
Our commitment to child safety is guided by the following principles, which align with global norms, including the Tech Coalition Child Safety Standards:
•	Prevention: We proactively monitor and moderate content to prevent CSAE using a combination of automated tools (e.g., AI-driven content scanning) and human review processes.
•	Detection and Removal: Any detected CSAM or CSAE-related content is promptly removed, and accounts involved are suspended or terminated.
•	Reporting Mechanisms: We provide clear, accessible in-app tools for users to report suspected CSAE. Reports are prioritized and reviewed immediately by our dedicated Child Safety Team.
•	Collaboration with Authorities: We cooperate fully with law enforcement, NCMEC, and other child safety organizations to report and address CSAE incidents.
•	User Education: We provide resources and information to educate users, parents, and guardians about online safety and how to report concerns.
•	Compliance with Laws: We adhere to all applicable local, national, and international laws regarding child safety, including mandatory reporting of CSAM.
